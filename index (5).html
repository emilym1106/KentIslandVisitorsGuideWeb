      <h3 id="introduction">History</h3>
      <p>Kent Island was established in 1631 and was only accessible by boat until 1964 when the first Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built. Kent Island is known for its abundance of crabs, fish, and other shellfish such as oysters, and nearly its entire purpose years ago was for the oyster business. Today, Kent Island is still home to many brackish sea creatures and now many people outside of that industry as well. It is home to historic Stevensville and Chester, and connects to the rest of the Eastern shore through the Kent Narrows and the Western shore by the Bay Bridge.</p>
